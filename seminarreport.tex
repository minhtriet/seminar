\section{Introduction}

Object recognition in real cluttered environments is hard where objects usually touch or occlude each other.
The paper presents a novel approach to solve the problem using geometric based categorization and perceptual grouping.
Geometric based categorization categorizes the different objects according to their general geometric shape (spheres, boxes, flat objects, cylindrical objects, and disks/plates).
Perceptual grouping choose what geometric shapes stick together to form an object.                                                      

\section{Method}
The main idea of the paper is Inspired by the ideas introduced by Biederman [6] (TODO: Say somthing more about it) recognition-by-components: A theory of human image understanding. Psychological Review (1987)

The idea is also supported in Improving Spatial Support for Objects
via Multiple Segmentations

In paper 29
If the feature is additive, the descriptor that would be computed for the object is
the same as the sum of the features of its segments

There are of course multiple ways of combining segments and not all of them
create a valid object. However, we can test if a combination is valid by checking if
the combined feature vector is known. We also exploit the fact that segments and
their connections (neighborhood relations) can be treated as a graph, and only
certain types of sub-graphs are present in the graph formed by the parts of an
object. Checking for subgraph isomorphism is not practical, but there are several
descriptors one can employ to rule out isomorphism. Thus, during training we
decompose  our  objects  into  parts,  compute  the  features  for  each  part,  build
the part-graph, and generate all sub-graphs along with their combined features.
Figure 2 shows an overview of the main steps of our method

\section{Steps}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Object categorization
    \item Build graph for each part
    \item Selection of Geometry-Based Categories
    \item Calculate arrangement keys
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{RSD}
The Radius-Based Surface Descriptor encodes the radial relationship of the point and its neighborhood. For every pair of the keypoint with a neighbor, the algorithm computes the distance between them, and the difference between their normals. Then, by assuming that both points lie on the surface of a sphere, said sphere is found by fitting not only the points, but also the normals (otherwise, there would be infinite possible spheres). Finally, from all the point-neighbor spheres, only the ones with the maximum and minimum radii are kept and saved to the descriptor of that point.

As you may have deduced already, when two points lie on a flat surface, the sphere radius will be infinite. If, on the other hand, they lie on the curved face of a cylinder, the radius will be more or less the same as that of the cylinder. This allows us to tell objects apart with RSD. The algorithm takes a parameter that sets the maximum radius at which the points will be considered to be part of a plane.

\subsection{GRSD}
GRSD is a histogram that counts the number of transitions between different types of voxels (Sphere, box, rectangle, cylindrical, plate).


\subsection{GRSD-}
adapted the GRSD feature to be additive, by simplifying it to simple histogram of neighborhoods of surfaces of different type, neglecting the ray-tracing step

\subsection{C3-HLAC}
C3-HLAC is calculated in a volume of a 3 × 3 × 3 grid around a center voxel \(x\).

Let \(r(x), g(x), b(x)\) be the red, green, blue value of voxel \(x\) and \(V\) be the voxel grid and \(\vec{a}\) be a displacement vector from the reference voxel to its neighboring voxel. Since these values are summed up around a voxel grid, there is redundant computation of the same value over symmetric pairs of \(a_i\). As a result, the number of variations in \(a_i\) is 13, which is a half of the 26 neighbors of voxel \(x\). 
\[
    r_1(x)=sin(\frac{\pi}{2}r(x))\\
    g_1(x)=sin(\frac{\pi}{2}g(x))\\
    b_1(x)=sin(\frac{\pi}{2}b(x))\\
    r_2(x)=sin(\frac{\pi}{2}r(x))\\
    g_2(x)=sin(\frac{\pi}{2}g(x))\\
    b_2(x)=sin(\frac{\pi}{2}b(x))\\
    f(x)=\begin{cases}
        [r_1(x) r_2(x) g_1(x) g_2(x) b_1(x) b_2(x)]^T & p(x)=1\\
        [0 0 0 0 0 0]^T & p(x)=0
    \end{cases}
    q_1(a_i)=\sum_x^Vf(x)f^T(x+a_i)\\\
\]

\subsection{VORSCH}
In order to generate VORSCH one refines the C 3 -HLAC descriptor to be rotation-invariant by bringing all 13 different vectors given by \(q_1\) together in the following equation:
\[q_2=\sum_{i=0}{12} \sum_x^V f(x)f^T(x+a_i)\]
